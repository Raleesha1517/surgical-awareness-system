<p>
Walk about 30 minutes per day at least 5 days per week.  
Walk at a comfortable speed but one that makes you sweat due to exertion.
If you have access to a staircase, climb up and down two flights of steps twice a day.
Gradually increase your level of exercise - do not over exert yourself suddenly 
A Caution:  If you  have  heart  orlung disease, get a chest pain or become excessively breathless stop and consult your doctor about exercise plan
